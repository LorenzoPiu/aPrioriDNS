# Tutorial dataset

This folder contains a dataset to use to test the library. The dataset was extracted from a DNS simulation of a [lifted non-premixed hydrogen jet flame](https://blastnet.github.io/jung2021.html). 

The domain was reduced to a size of 200x200x100 grid points, without changing the formatting.
